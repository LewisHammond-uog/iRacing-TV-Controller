General
	Find out why it always says 4x for incident messages
	Color code message types
		Red - incidents
		Yellow - black flags
Incident messages
	Also show total incidents accumulated for the driver
Flags
	Look into displaying black flags for each driver
		Got furled black flag
		Cleared furled black flag
	Meatball flags
Pits
	Show pit time when driver leaves the pits (xx.xs)
	Seems like there is a way to get pit stop time???
